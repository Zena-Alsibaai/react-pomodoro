## About the project :

It was a challenge assigned by [BECODE](https://becode.org/) training center. To create a simple Pomodoro timer without need for a server.

## The mission :

-   Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).

-   Four buttons:

    -   plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
    -   start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
    -   reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value

-   At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:

    -   One to close the modal

    -   Another to close the modal and start a new timer

### _Times limit_ :

5 days
